# Women Coders Bot

An open-source, community-driven Twitter bot created by [Sara Torrey](https://github.com/SaraTorrey) and [Dan Torrey](https://github.com/danotorrey) to support all women who code. Click [here](https://twitter.com/WomenCodersBot) to view the Bot on Twitter.

## What does it do?

The [Women Coders Bot](https://twitter.com/WomenCodersBot) retweets tweets containing the following hashtags: #GirlsWhoCode, #GirlsCanCode  #MomsCanCode, #MomsWhoCode, #WomenWhoCode, #WomenCanCode, #WomenCoders 

## Why was it created?

This bot was created as a way to provide all women coders (and especially newcomers) a way to get support from the 
community. Sometimes, new coders might feel alone when taking their first development steps and posting their first 
tweets. Now, these women have a way to immediately share their progress and connect with the coding community. 
The main idea is, people can follow this bot to easily support these new women coders.

Also, you have probably seen many bots on Twitter, but you probably have not seen many that are open source. 
Our goal with Women Coders Bot is to provide the community to see exactly how this bot works (the code), and to have 
a say in how it operates. 

## How does it work?

This is written in Java (using [Twitter4j](https://github.com/Twitter4J/Twitter4J) and [Spring Boot](http://spring.io/projects/spring-boot))
and is deployed in [Heroku](http://heroku.com). It costs about 7$ per month to keep running, which is the cost to run a small Java application in Heroku.
